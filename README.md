Simple tool to send mass-mails
==============================

This tool aims at those poor souls, who have agreed to maintain a certain amount
of stability to their hackerspaces' financial situation. So, if you're a the
cashmaster of your hackerspace and have to contact a subset of your members via 
e-mail, this tool is for you.

What it does
------------

If you throw a .csv file and the text of you e-mail at it, it will send the mail
for you with the correct names and other fields of your csv in the right places.
Nothing more, nothing less.

How it works
------------

./mailsender.py \<membershipdata.csv\> \<mail.txt\>

Caveats
-------

This is not intended for you to spam other people with it. If you do so, you're
a complete and utter dickhead and I hope you step on a lego every waking day.

I obviously can't stop you from spamming anybody but seriously, if you do and I
happen to find you ... well let's just quote "300": This will not be over quickly
and you will not enjoy it.
